For the one year anniversary of my grandmother's passing, my family got together for a reunion in Puerto Rico. Since the flight to PR is now a 10+ hour ordeal from San Francisco instead of a quick 3 hour flight from New York, we decided to make a full blown vacation out of it. Above is a quick taste of all the fun we had in the sun, at locations such as Old San Juan, Dorado, Luquillo, Ponce, and El Yunque.
