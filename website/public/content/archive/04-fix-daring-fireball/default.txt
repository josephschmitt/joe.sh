As those who follow John Gruber's [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net) know, whenever the Yankees make it into the playoffs, Gruber replaces his fireball logo with an incredibly annoying Yankees logo. To remedy this situation, I wrote a quick [Safari](http://github.com/downloads/josephschmitt/Fix-Daring-Fireball-Logo/fixdf.safariextz) and [Chrome](http://github.com/downloads/josephschmitt/Fix-Daring-Fireball-Logo/fixdf.chromeextension.crx) extension that replaces the incorrect[^1] logo with either the normal DF one, or with an alternate:

Normal Daring Fireball

Alternate Daring Fireball

Fixed.

I also let you choose between all 3 non-Yankee teams that made the division series, not just the Phillies:

Might as well be fair to everyone.

[^1]: I really don't care what John puts as the logo; it's his website and he can do whatever he wants. I just thought it'd be a fun little exercise to write the extension. I'm definitely not one of the 1,000's complaining about him being a Yankees fan: he can be whatever he likes.
