## 🔑 Critical Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Setup (Days 1-2)
```bash
# Create migration branch
git checkout -b astro-migration

# Initialize Astro project
mkdir astro-blog && cd astro-blog
npm create astro@latest . -- --template minimal --typescript strict

# Install dependencies
npm install -D @astrojs/mdx @astrojs/rss sass decap-cms-app
```

### Phase 2: Automated Content Migration (Day 5)
```bash
# Run migration script (provided in full plan)
npx tsx scripts/migrate-kirby-content.ts
# ✓ Migrates all 16 posts
# ✓ Copies all 104 images
# ✓ Converts KirbyText → MDX components
```

### Phase 3: Run Both Systems (Days 11-12)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Old Kirby site
docker-compose up  # localhost:8090

# Terminal 2: New Astro site  
npm run dev        # localhost:4321

# Compare side-by-side
```

### Phase 4: Deploy to Netlify (Day 13)
```bash
# Deploy preview
netlify deploy

# Test at preview URL
# https://deploy-preview-XXX--joe-sh.netlify.app
```

### Phase 5: Go Live (Day 16)
```bash
# Deploy production
netlify deploy --prod

# Update DNS
joe.sh → Netlify (automatic SSL)
```

---

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Zero Downtime Migration
- Keep Kirby running on current server
- Deploy Astro to preview URL first
- Test everything before DNS switch
- DNS cutover takes ~5 minutes

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# If issues occur, revert DNS immediately
# Both systems can run simultaneously
# <1 hour rollback time
```

### URL Preservation
- All old URLs redirect to new structure
- `/qc-tips` → `/2013-05-23-qc-tips/`
- SEO ranking preserved
- RSS feed redirects configured
